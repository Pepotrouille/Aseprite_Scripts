## What does the script do?

It converts one cel spritesheet into the right amont of layers and frames. It can help you to:
 - Import spritesheet using layers easily
 - Export a grid of elements into single elements png files with well organised names using layer names, with for instance the following script from GASPI https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/blob/main/scripts/gaspi/export_layers.lua You can see an example of it through my Fantasy Items pack 16x16 on my Itch.io

## How to use

The Script window will ask you the size of the final cel, width and height (16x16, 64x64...)
You will also see two other option, 
 - The first one is two turn on/off the visibility of all layers after the script
 - The second one will ask if the layer on front/ont top is the layer located on the top or bottom of your current spritesheet.

Finally, I recommend to save the newly created file in a different file so you keep your spritesheet
