In this repository, you should be able to find small automated tasks that I use during my work.  
Some might not be useful to people, but I share it in case someone find a way to use it one day :)  
  
The scripts currently in this repository:
- Spritesheet Into Layers: Converts one cell into a given amont of layers and frames,
